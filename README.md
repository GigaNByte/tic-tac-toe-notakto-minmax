Notakto rules are as follows:

• Both players alternate making an X on the board.

• Players may mark on X on an available space (again, any space not already occupied by an X) any available board during their turn.

• The person who makes a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of 3 Xs on the board is the loser.
